at Where will we use it?
* Decouple Code: we can change which method gets called without changing the rest of code
* Handle Events: They are often used to handle events, like buttons or game events
* Implement CallBacks: callbacks, one part of code tells another part to do something


Delegates types

* Single Delegates: to a single method at a time
* Multiple Delegates: to multiple method at a time
