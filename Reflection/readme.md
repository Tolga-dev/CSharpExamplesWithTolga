Reflection

to write code that can read, write code in runtime

it is a ability that some programming language have to inspect their own constructs dynamically

* we can load a class dynamically from an assembly

basics, hierarchy of its programming constructs
* Assemblies contain modules
* Modules contain types
* Types contain members

it is needed when you want to determine the content of an assembly.

reflection inspects the assembly and shows the metadata of that assembly
